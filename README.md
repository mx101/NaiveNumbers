# NaiveNumbers
## Current:
Takes in 28 lines of string input and classifies this as a number from 0-9.
Classifies using a Naive Bayes Classifier. Training data must be either previously provided or generated using a set of images and pre-classified labels.

## Future Plans:
- [ ] Read in input from a photo
- [ ] Have machine automatically adjust off-center images
- [ ] Classify characters as well
